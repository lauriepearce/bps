<p>When a corpus owner accepts the ODC-ODbL, they designate the uploaded corpus as Open Data, which means that any other user of BPS who imports the corpus into their workspace is free to <strong>share</strong> (copy, distribute and use), to <strong>create</strong> (new works from), and to <strong>adapt</strong> (modify, transform, and build on) the database.</p> 
<p>The BPS user who imports that database agrees to comply with the ODC-ODbL, namely to: 
<ul>
	<li><strong>attribute</strong> any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the ODbL. For any use or redistribution of the database, or works produced from it, the user must make clear to others the license of the database and keep intact any notices on the original database. </li>
	<li><strong>share-alike</strong>, i.e. offer under the ODbL any adapted version of the uploaded database, or works produced from a publicaly adapted database. </li>
	<li><strong>keep open</strong>, i.e., redistribute a version of the original database, if the user redistributes the database, or an adapted version of it, with technological measures that restrict the work (such as DRM). </li>
</ul>
