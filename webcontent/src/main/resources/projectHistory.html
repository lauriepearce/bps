<p style="text-align: justify;">Berkeley Prospography Services (BPS) grew out of an ambitious exploration on the UC Berkeley campus into the feasibility of building reusable, extensible digital tools for humanities research. Over the course of several campus workshops in 2007, Professor <a href="http://nes.berkeley.edu/Web_Veldhuis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Niek Veldhuis</a> and Patrick Schmitz discussed the possibility of applying algorithms of probabilistic reasoning to workflows familiar to scholars engaged in prosopographical research. Scholars who study social, economic, intellectual communities routinely pose questions such as "How likely is it that two instances of the name <i>Bob</i> refer to the same individual in the text(s) under investigation?".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Veldhuis approached Laurie Pearce, his colleague in Berkeley's Department of Near Eastern Studies, about creating a digital corpus of cuneiform texts to serve as a development corpus with which to explore the potential of BPS to support humanities research. That corpus, ~500 cuneiform legal texts from Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq), contains many name instances and presents examples of papponymy, the practice of naming a child after an ancestor, which leads to a restricted, highly limited inventory of names. As a result, it is often difficult to determine whether two mentions of a name refer to the same individual.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conversation, Veldhuis, Schmitz, and Pearce articulated rules that Pearce applied, seemingly automatically, as she reads a text and attempts to disambiguate namesakes as individual persons. These conversations led to the conclusion that each prosopographer develops a rule set specific to that corpus, and that a toolkit could be developed that utilized rules familiar to each researcher. This would lead to the development of a corpus-agnostic toolkit that didn't force researchers to conform to an external research framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A series of workshops followed, in which we invited researchers working with cuneiform text corpora from a number of different time periods, and which demonstrated different naming patterns. Our outreach to other specialists in cuneiform studies was predicated on the idea of building research communities from a foundation of shared interests and common methdologies. As BPS has matured, we have included papyrologists and classicists in our community of partners; we expect that researchers in fields at a chronologic and geographic remove from the ancient world will find BPS to be of value as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BPS soon attracted the attention of some of the leading supporters of humanities research, and has received <a href="http://berkeleyprosop.digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support from the NEH</a> from 2010-2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012-2013, Davide Semenzin served as an intern on BPS, developing the SNA visualization component. The work he did on BPS served as the core of his <a href="https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/282685" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Master's thesis</a> at the University of Utrecht. From 2015-2018, Davide rejoined the BPS team as a core developer.</p>
